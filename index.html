        <h1>310 AR Clientele Project</h1>
        <p>This project was made and developed in XCode using Swift as the target language. A group of five including myself worked with two long distance clients from University of Mississippi to develop an application targeted towards younger children with special needs. I have also included a video below which encapsulated our thought process, workflow, and demonstrates out application.</p>

        <h1>360 VR Chunity</h1>
        <p>This project showcases some of the VR work I have been developing in Unity. The project itself combines the musical programming language Chuck with the Unity engine. I spent around three weeks developing a simple drum machine controlled by XR Hand tracking and playing beats on object collision using synthesized audio from Chuck.</p>
